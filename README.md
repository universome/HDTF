## Details of HDTF dataset
**./HDTF_dataset** consists of *youtube video url*, *video resolution* (in our method, may not be the best resolution), *time stamps of talking face*, *facial region* (in the our method) and *the zoom scale* of the cropped window.

## Processing of HDTF dataset
When using HDTF dataset,

 - We provide video and url in  **xx_video_url.txt**. (the highest definition of videos are 1080P or 720P).  Transform video into **.mp4** format and transform interlaced video to progressive video as well.

 - We split long original video into talking head clips with time stamps in **xx_annotion_time.txt**.  Name the splitted clip as **video name_clip index.mp4**. For example, split the video  *Radio11.mp4 00:30-01:00 01:30-02:30*  into *Radio11_0.mp4* and *Radio11_1.mp4* .

 - Our work does not always download videos with the best resolution, so we provide two cropping methods. Thanks @universome and @Feii Yin for pointing out this problem!

	1. Download the video with reference resulotion in **xx_resolution.txt** and crop the facial region with fixed window size in **xx_crop_wh.txt**. (This method is as same as ours, but the downloaded video may not be the best resolution).
	2. First, download the video with best resulotion. Then, detect the facial landmark in the splitted talking head clips and count the square window of the face, specifically, count the facial region in each frame and merge all regions into one square range. Next,  enlarge the window size with **xx_crop_ratio.txt**. Finally, crop the facial region.

- We resize all cropped videos into **512 x 512** resolution.

The code is in **./code_constructing_Fapp**, pls visit [here](https://github.com/MRzzm/HDTF/tree/main/code_constructing_Fapp) for more details. 

#### code of animation-to-video module
The code is in **./code_animation2video**, pls visit [here](https://github.com/MRzzm/HDTF/tree/main/code_animation2video) for more details. 

#### code of reproducing other works
coming soon......

## Downloading
For convenience, we added the `download.py` script which downloads, crops and resizes the dataset. You can use it via the following command:
```
python download.py --output_dir /path/to/output/dir --num_workers 8
```

Note: some videos might become unavailable if the authors will remove them or make them private.
